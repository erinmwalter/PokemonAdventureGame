# PokemonAdventureGame

OOP Practice - started, but didn't finish, making a console app in C# where a user could choose a pokemon
trainer, could catch pokemon, could battle other trainers (this functionality was never finished), and could
"find a pokemon in the wild at random" to battle in order to train their pokemon.
